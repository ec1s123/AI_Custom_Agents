# AI_Custom_Agents
Leveraging Prompt Engineering to Reduce Class Drop Rates — Internship Project at Maryville University

During my internship at Maryville University, I was given a meaningful challenge:
Reduce student drop rates in the university's most underperforming courses using custom AI agents.

To address this, I developed a series of custom AI agents using modern prompt engineering techniques and dynamic model selection tailored to the specific needs of each class and scenario.

Project Goals:
Identify and target courses with high dropout rates
Design AI-driven interventions to support student engagement
Test and refine custom agents through iterative prompt engineering
Ensure each model used was best-fit for its unique task

Model Selection Strategy
In an era of rapidly evolving AI capabilities, I recognized that no single model is universally best. Instead, 
I analyzed the strengths of available LLMs and selected the most appropriate model based on the scenario — whether that meant prioritizing reasoning, creativity, speed, or task specificity.

Prompt Engineering: RTFC + Iterative Refinement
I applied and expanded on the Role, Task, Format, Context (RTFC) prompt framework to create high-performing, structured instructions for each agent. This allowed the agents to perform consistently and reliably across a range of use cases.
As complexity increased, I developed my own variant — the Philosophy Custom Agent — which used modular, bite-sized instruction sets and layered reasoning for improved outcomes.
